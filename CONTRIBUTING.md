# Contribute to Lattice

## Setting Up a Local Copy

1. Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/latticejs/lattice`

2. Run `yarn` in the root `lattice` folder.

Once it is done, you can modify any file locally and run `yarn start`, `yarn test` or `yarn build` just like in a generated project.

### Customized React Scripts 

If you want to try out the `@lattice/react-scripts` locally, you can run this command on the root `lattice` folder:

```
yarn create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
```

and then run `yarn start` or `yarn build`.
